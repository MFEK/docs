Some people might look at the name of this repository and think it is something to do with QAnon, because of the pervasiveness of QAnon in American culture, and because its principal author, Fredrick Brennan, founded 8chan.

**This project has nothing to do with QAnon and I oppose QAnon completely.**

I have, since leaving 8chan, been a vocal critic of both it and QAnon. [This is](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/8chan) [well documented](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/QAnon). The name of this repository is me reclaiming my favorite letter, &lsaquo;Q&rsaquo;&mdash;they can't have it.

On Wikipedia I go by [User:Psiĥedelisto](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User:Psiĥedelisto). I wrote &sect; Typography on Wikipedia's [Q article](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Q) long before QAnon even began.
